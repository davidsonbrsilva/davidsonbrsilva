Thank you for your visit! I am a developer with a degree in Information Systems from [Federal University of the Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys]() and I've been worked as a lead developer at [dti digital](https://www.dtidigital.com.br/) ([@dtidigitalcrafters](https://github.com/dtidigitalcrafters)). In the programming world, I am mainly interested in Artificial Intelligence, Compilers and Web Development.

Most of the content on my Github was created with the intention of learning or reinforcing some knowledge, therefore, the most relevant works with which I had contact will not be here. Even so, you can take them as a reference for my code style.

## Need me for a job?

 I have market experience in developing APIs with microservices in .Net (C#) and developing user interfaces with React and React Native. I have solid knowledge in CSS and SASS, semantic HTML and JavaScript in the latest versions from ECMAScript 6. I am currently looking for improvement in frameworks such as Vue and Svelte and in my English skills.

I know the best practices pointed out by the Clean, Onion and Hexagonal architectures, as well as DDD (Domain-Driven Development), DevOps and building CI/CD mats. I also relate a lot to UX/UI issues.

See more information on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsonbrsilva/).
